# north-west(when supply=demand)
The North-West Corner Rule is a method adopted to compute the initial feasible solution of the transportation problem.
It can be assumed as a two-dimensional table with demands and supplies as columns and rows
Variables rows and columns contain the values of rows and columns.
Considering total supply=total demand, we check the north-west corner element, taking the least values of it's supply and demand,taking it as the selected one and the other is decreased by the selected.
The process is done till zero elements are left.
The next version where supply!=demand will be uploaded soon.
